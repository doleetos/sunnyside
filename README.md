## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I decided to use ReactJS for this project since I just finished learning the basics of it.
This project took a hot minute to finish, but I am very satisfied with the result!
Also, it helped me settle and ground what I've been learning:
- JSX
- Components
- State hooks (Holy moly this one took QUITE SOME TIME to get the hang of it and really understand what's going on... ðŸ˜­)

### Continued development

I want to add more styles and components to make the website more interactive and user appealing.
Stay tuned for upcoming updates!
